      <description>Curiously Recurring Template Pattern(CRTP) in C++ is definitely a powerful technique &amp;amp; static alternative to virtual functions. But at the same time, learning it may seem a bit weird at first. If you are like me who struggled to grasp anything in one go. Then this article might help you to provide a thought process on where CRTP fits in day-to-day coding. And, if you are an Embedded Programmer, you may run into CRTP more often.</description>

      <description>So I have started updating myself with Modern C++ a while ago &amp;amp; since my post 21 new features of Modern C++ to use in your project &amp;amp; All about lambda function in C++ was popular I decided to write about advance C++ concepts &amp;amp; idioms which I have learned from this wikibook &amp;amp; course.
There are many other advance C++ concepts &amp;amp; idioms as well but I consider these 7 as &amp;ldquo;should-know&amp;rdquo;.</description>
