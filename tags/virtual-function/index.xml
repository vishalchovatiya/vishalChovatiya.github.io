      <description>In this article, we will see the memory layout of different C++ Object. And how different storage &amp;amp; access specifiers affect this memory footprint. I am not going to discuss compiler augmented code, name mangling &amp;amp; working of any C++ mechanism related to memory as it is compiler &amp;amp; architecture-dependent. To keep this further simple, I have considered the standard stack growth direction i.e. downwards. And with the same, data members are represented inverted in memory(thanks to Thomas Vermeilh for pointing that out), that too I have ignored for simplicity.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;All About Virtual Keyword in C++&amp;rdquo; is a series of articles(total of three, PART 1, PART 2, PART 3) describe working of the virtual keyword in different scenarios. This article mostly focuses on &amp;ldquo;How Does Virtual Function Works Internally?&amp;rdquo;. In other words, How dynamic dispatch done in C++! Although I am not a compiler writer, but this is what I have learned so far from various sources, courses, books &amp;amp; disassembly of C++ program.</description>
