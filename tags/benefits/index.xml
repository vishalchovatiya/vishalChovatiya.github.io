      <description>So you know how to code in general, understand the object-oriented programming, learned C++, and completed at least one Software Development Course (if youâ€™re not there yet, these articles aren&amp;rsquo;t for you). You can write software easily if you know at least one programming language, but is your code any good? Could it be done any better? Is it clean (and what on earth does that mean)? Is your architecture any good?</description>

      <description>Dependency Inversion Principle in C++ is the fifth &amp;amp; last design principle of a series SOLID as a Rock design principles. The SOLID design principles focus on developing software that is easy to maintainable, reusable &amp;amp; extendable. In this article, we will see an example code with the flaw &amp;amp; correct it with help of DIP. We will also see guideline &amp;amp; benefits of DIP in closure of the article.</description>

      <description>Interface Segregation Principle in C++ is the fourth &amp;amp; by far the simplest design principle of a series SOLID as a Rock design principles. The SOLID design principles focus on developing software that is easy to maintainable, reusable &amp;amp; extendable. In this article, we will see a code violating ISP, a solution to the same code, guideline &amp;amp; benefits of ISP.
By the way, If you haven&amp;rsquo;t gone through my previous articles on design principles, then below is the quick links:</description>
