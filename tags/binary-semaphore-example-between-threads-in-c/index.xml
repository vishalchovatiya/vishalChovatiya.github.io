      <description>Semaphore is a synchronization mechanism. In more words, semaphores are a technique for coordinating or synchronizing activities in which multiple processes compete for the same resources. There are 2 types of semaphores: Binary semaphores &amp;amp; Counting semaphores. But our focus would be on binary semaphore only. That too binary semaphore example between threads in C language specifically. If you are in search of semaphore between processes then see this.
As its name suggest binary semaphore can have a value either 0 or 1.</description>
